In the head of each script you need to change this data:

	#=============================================================  
	server_name="your_server"  
	admin_login="your_login"  
	admin_password="your_password"  
	#=============================================================  

**Note**: in files with data (lists of ip addresses or accounts) should not be empty lines.  
Each ip address, domains or account should be on a separate line.  

If the data file has been successfully processed by the script,
in the end of the data file will be automatically 
recorded information that the file has been processed.  
Before starting of work, each script checks if line with this information exists in the data file.
If this line is in the file -   it is mean the file has been processed
and the script not start its work.

-----------------------------------

Before working each script checks the data file.
If the data file contains several identical lines,
console displays additional information and the script does not begin its work.
